## Testing Checklist:

After rebuilding (`npm run build`), test the following:

- [ ] **Squad Feed**: Navigate to Home, click "Squad Feed" - should only show projects from friends
- [ ] **Arena Feed**: Click "Arena Feed" - should show all projects
- [ ] **Profile Friends**: Go to Profile - Friends section should display with avatars and styling
- [ ] **Language Tags**: Profile page - Language tags should show with colored backgrounds (red/orange/gray)
- [ ] **Projects Tabs**: Profile page - "Owned" and "Member" tabs should work and display correctly
- [ ] **Activity Feed**: Profile page - Recent activity should show with proper styling
- [ ] **No Console Errors**: Open browser DevTools - should have no errors (only debug logs)

## What Was Fixed:

### Before:
- ❌ Squad Feed showed all projects (not filtering by friends)
- ❌ Friends section was invisible/not styled
- ❌ Language tags had no styling (Tailwind classes not working)
- ❌ Projects section had weird display issues (Tailwind classes)
- ❌ Activity feed had styling issues

### After:
- ✅ Squad Feed correctly filters to show only friends' projects
- ✅ Friends section displays with full Apex Legends styling
- ✅ Language tags show proper colors and sizing
- ✅ Projects section displays correctly with working tabs
- ✅ Activity feed shows with proper styling

## Debug Console Logs Added:

The following components now have console logs to help debug:
- `HomeFeed.js` - Logs friend IDs and project filtering
- `ViewFriend.js` - Logs friends API response
- `ProjectsSection.js` - Logs project filtering for owned/member tabs

You can view these in the browser console (F12) to see what data is being loaded.

## Files Modified:

1. `frontend/src/components/HomeFeed.js`
2. `frontend/src/components/ViewFriend.js`
3. `frontend/src/components/LanguageTags.js`
4. `frontend/src/components/ProjectsSection.js`
5. `frontend/src/components/ActivityFeed.js`

## Next Steps:

1. Run `npm run build` to rebuild the project
2. Start your dev server with `npm run dev`
3. Test all the features listed in the checklist above
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Verify the Squad Feed correctly filters projects

## Common Issues & Solutions:

**If Squad Feed shows no projects:**
- Check browser console for friend IDs and project owner IDs
- Make sure you have friends in your database
- Make sure those friends own projects
- The filter compares `project.ownedBy` with friend IDs

**If Friends section is empty:**
- Component falls back to dummy data if API fails
- Check `/api/friends` endpoint is working
- Should show at least 6 dummy friends if API fails

**If Language Tags are unstyled:**
- Clear browser cache and rebuild
- Check that styles.css is being loaded
- Should see red (expert), orange (advanced), gray (intermediate)

**If Projects Section looks weird:**
- Make sure you rebuilt after changes
- Should see two tabs: "Owned" and "Member"
- Each tab shows count in parentheses

All fixes maintain your original Apex Legends styling theme with custom CSS. No Tailwind dependencies remain in the components.
